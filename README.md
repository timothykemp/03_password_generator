# 03_Password_Generator

## Description

This password generator web application was my third homework assignment in the KU Coding Bootcamp. The purpose of this assignment was to experience how coding in JavaScript can make web applications much more interactive and robust.

This particular web application required me to plan out the logic using psuedocoding initial, since the requirements for the application involved several dynamic variables and interaction based on the user's input.

The application itself had the following requirements, all of which have been met (along with some additional improvements I decided to add enhance the user experience):

## Screenshots & Functionality Explanations

The following image shows the web application's appearance upon the initial load:

When the user clicks on "Generate Password" button, the following prompt will appear asking them to enter a desired password length:

If user clicks on "Cancel", the following message will appear instead of a generated password:

![User Cancel Message](./assets/images/user_cancel_message.png?raw=true)

If user clicks "OK", if the application determines the user's entry as invalid (see details above), the following alert will appear. If the user clicks "OK" on the alert, they are able to try submitting a desired password length again:

## Important Notes

1. This project has been deployed and does produce truly random passwords; however, it is not advisable at this time to utilize this site for creating passwords you intend to actually use as there is no encryption built in to the application.

1. The HTML, CSS, and initial JavaScript files were provided for me. My assignment was to code the Generate Password function from scratch within the provided JavaScript file.
